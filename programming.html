                <h3>Introduction</h3> This is our CS370 project for the Fall 2020 semester.
                Welcome to Amiga, a mental health app that was created to help users
                keep track of their mental health and get insights on their
                progress. Project Members: Anthony Fiddes (PO), Alex Welsh, Caroline
                Yoon, Julia Levine, Anna Mola, Mario Becerra Aleman, and Rahul Nair
                (SM) <h3>Project Purpose</h3> With many of our classmates, friends, and loved
                ones being worn thin by the ever-increasing pressures of school,
                work, and society, it is more important than ever to keep an eye on
                our mental well-being. Ninety-five percent of college counseling
                center directors surveyed said the number of students with
                significant psychological problems is a growing concern in their
                center or on campus, according to the latest Association for
                University and College Counseling Center Directors survey of
                counseling center directors. We felt the issue particularly relevant
                for university students, many of whom are experiencing college
                virtually. More than ever, it is crucial for students to create and
                sustain healthy habits for the maintenance of their mental health.
                <h3>The Intent and Approach</h3>  Amiga aims to improve the mental health
                of its users by logging moods and emotions over time, thereby
                enabling the visualization and analysis of their mental health.
                Getting into the habit of keeping logs and to-dos is an important
                way of relieving work/societal stressors; we believe the
                satisfaction from completing tasks and removing impediments from
                one's daily life is an important first step in improving mental
                health. Using the Stats feature, users can visualize their moods
                over time, with ratings viewable over a week, a month, and even a
                year. With regular use, these graphs can be shared externally, such
                as with a psychiatrist or licensed social worker. The Maps feature
                locates the user and suggests nearby location aimed to help relieve
                stress, such as local libraries, caf√©s, parks, and therapist
                offices. Users can select a nearby location and open an integrated
                navigation client to get there quickly and safely. An integrated
                To-Do List feature populates tasks to a simple list that the user
                can then complete as needed. We hope that users gather a feeling of
                accomplishment as they check off items from the list. All of these
                features are gamified through the implementation of the Achievements
                feature, which rewards users with fun badges based on their level of
                usage of Amiga. Increased usage is rewarded with increasingly rare
                badges and icons. <h3>Getting Started</h3> Get started with Amiga by opening
                the app and creating an account with your email address and
                password. Your email address is the key bit of information that
                makes your account unique. Once you've created your account, you can
                select a cartoon avatar to reflect who you are to others on the app.
                <h3>Using Amiga</h3> Create your first log on the home screen by selecting
                your mood using the slider, adding some "journal entry" text, and
                selecting some moods to associate with your log. The moods and
                emotions can be tracked in a variety of places, such as in the Stats
                page. Logging daily will increase your Streak, which tabulates how
                many consecutive days you've logged for. Keep logging daily to
                increase your streak and unlock bold new achievements. It's helpful
                to read over your logs in the Feed page, where you can see how you
                felt day-over-day. You can also track these trends over longer
                periods of time using the Stats page's mood graph, which charts date
                against mood. The color-rich interface is designed to make seeing
                and understanding your logs easy, quick, and stress-free. To-dos are
                a simple part of life, and tracking them in Amiga makes it that much
                easier to get things done. Simply write down what you need to get
                done. Amiga stores that item for you, and when you complete it, come
                back to Amiga to cross it off. Satisfying!<h3>Friends and Achievements</h3> 
                Amiga is more fun with friends! Add friends by inserting their email
                address in the Friends tab. This will send them a friend request,
                and after it is accepted, you can visualize each others'
                achievements and more! Comparing streaks with friends is fun on
                Amiga and keeps you on top of your logging game while also
                developing positive habits and helping you track your mood.
